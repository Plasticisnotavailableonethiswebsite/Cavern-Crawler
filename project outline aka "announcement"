The game Cavern Crawler is a procedurally generated endless fight for your life as you explore the caverns that have always been beneath your feet.

The program Cavern Crawler will obviously generate caverns, enemies, have a combat system, make sure the player can't run thru a wall. 
  you know...general game mechanics stuff.
  Once the basic game functionality has been achieved, AI will be integrated to automate variation inside the game. 
    For instance, generating new enemy types and unique behaviors for each new type. 
    Additionally having enemies interact with the environment and circumstance in an instrumentally rational manner. IE this action gives this goal
          But what goal should the enemies strive for? It should be a "good goal" right? But what is a good goal for them? How would they value? 
          Do they, and if so how would they, have the concept of a short term and long term goal? More importantly, why do they think this action leads to this goal? 
  These are the types of functions and questions I wish to integrate.
  
The project Cavern Crawler is simply me trying to figure out how to do this...
